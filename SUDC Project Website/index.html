            Hi, my name is Mandy! I live in Jakarta, where I am pursuing a
            bachelor degree in Information Systems. My passion for technology
            has always driven me to explore new possibilities, and this journey
            led me to focus on cloud computing, with a specific interest in
            becoming a skilled back-end developer. I love the idea of building
            complex applications and websites that solve real-world problems
            through logic and creativity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alongside my academic pursuits, I also have a creative side—I enjoy
            making content for TikTok and Instagram. Social media has become a
            fun way for me to share my interests and experiences with others,
            and it's one of my favorite hobbies.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my proudest achievements was winning the international
            competition “ACIYLS 2023,” where I represented Indonesia in
            Singapore. During the competition, I had the honor of leading a team
            to develop a start-up idea that tackled sustainable challenges. This
            experience sharpened my leadership and problem-solving skills and
            gave me valuable insights into the start-up world.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have hands-on experience in product management through a
            project called "Reminderoo," a subscription management platform that
            my team and I developed. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge
            further by joining the Cloud Computing path at Bangkit 2024, where I
            am learning cutting-edge technologies to advance my career in tech.

            <p>
              In 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to represent Indonesia
              at the international competition "ACIYLS 2023" in Singapore. As a
              group leader, I guided my team in creating a start-up focused on
              addressing sustainable challenges. This experience not only
              enhanced my leadership capabilities but also deepened my
              understanding of sustainable practices in business. It was a
              remarkable journey that taught me the importance of innovation and
              collaboration.
